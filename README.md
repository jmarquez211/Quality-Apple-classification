This project involves classifying the quality of a set of apples based on their characteristics: 'size', 'weight', 'sweetness', 'crunchiness', 'juiciness', 'ripeness'. Depending on these values, they are classified as good or bad.

To perform this classification, data cleaning techniques, outlier detection, and standardization of values have been used. Once the data has been processed, classification algorithms are employed. For this case, Decision Tree Classifier and K-NN are used.
